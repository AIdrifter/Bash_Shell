# Closing A Deal
(Mr. Honda set another meeting with Mr. Chan after t
he first negotiation.)

Mr. Honda: Good morning, Mr. Chan. 
Thank you for the copy of your business proposal. 

Mr. Chan: So, that’s our offer. 
Every detail is transparent. We think it’s a fair one, 
with advantages on both sides.

Mr. Honda: Yes, well, we are prepared to consider your offer Mr.Chan 
if you can accept some of our conditions.

Mr. Chan: What are the conditions? The conditions are still 
subjected to the Boards agreement.

Mr. Honda: Well, firstly, the price you’re offering
. As stated in the proposal, the cost of the semiconductor is $21.
 Our board would like to have a concession from $21 to $19.50 
per unit and extending the contract from one year to two years. 

Mr. Chan: I think we could consider. That would be 
acceptable. 

Mr. Honda: Another problem we may have is that of supply.
 Our company often needs a supply at a short notice. 
If we do get large orders, we need to guarantee delivery 
– so we need to stockpile. How would you feel about the 
deferred payment? 

Mr. Chan:  You mean a loan? 

Mr. Honda: I suppose so. Bell Trading is going to order 500 stocks 
of advanced semiconductors which will be paid quarterly. 
But for the stockpile, we would like to consider a deferred payment.  
We would provide security of course. 

Mr. Chan: I think that would be acceptable. 
Fortunately, we have the boards approval for that.

Mr. Honda: Of course.

Mr. Chan: Then we have a deal.
