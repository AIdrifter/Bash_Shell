# Reporting to his Boss
(back in Japan)
Jun: Good morning, Mr. Stanton.
Mr. Stanton: Good morning Jun. Have a seat please.
How are you?
And how’s the trip to Hong Kong?

Jun: Oh yes, Boss! That’s what I’m here for. We had a great conversation about the agreement.

The good news is that I was able to close a very good deal.  Here are some papers for more details.

They had given us 20-30% discount for the 500 units purchased but for succeeding bulky purchases.

they will give us a higher discount and all products are of one year warranty.

By the way, they are going to deliver the products within a week.

Mr. Stanton: Congratulations! Mr. Jun Honda, you did a great job.

Jun: Thank you boss.

Mr. Stanton: You’re welcome Jun, but don’t forget our goal is to hit
our target market within three months. Well, as I see, we are on our track now. So I’m sure we can meet our
deadline. So far, you are doing an exceptional job!
 It was a good choice to have you handle this project.

Jun: This is what I’m paid for Sir. Thank you so much for that wonderful remark.
