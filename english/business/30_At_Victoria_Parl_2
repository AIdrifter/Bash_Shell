(Jun arrives at the park. 
There are a lot of people occupying the area 
around the statue of Queen Victoria. )

Jun: Hello, Madam. Good afternoon to you. 
I’m sorry to bother you. 
I’m Jun, a tourist from Japan and 
I’m interested to know about the event you are celebrating right now. 

Local: Hello. Good afternoon, Jun. I’m Miss Han, 
nice to meet you.  Is this your first visit in Hong Kong? 

Jun: Yes, it’s my first visit after a very long time.
I’m here for business matters and got a chance 
to stroll around the city.

Local: Oh, I see. Actually, 
we are celebrating the 19th Anniversary of Tiananmen Square. 

Jun: What’s something special about this celebration? 

Local: This is celebrated every 4th of June 
to commemorate the historical event of the massacre occurred after the
labor activist made a series of demonstration against the
Communist Party.

Jun: So this really is a major celebration in the entire city. 

Local: Yes, you’re right. At Victoria Park, we always celebrate the 
major festivals and also Lunar New Year Fair. 
This is because Victoria Park is the one of the main parks 
of the city and the largest one, too.    

Jun: Wow, that’s pretty impressive. 
In this view of the park, I can also see recreational areas 
for swimming, sports and etc. 
This place is really a good place to unwind.

By the way, we also have a lot of shop where you can relax.

Could you recommend one?
I think it’s about time for me to have relaxation. 

Local: Good thing you ask. You can see a white building from here.
