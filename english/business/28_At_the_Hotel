 How may I help you?

I would like to order a meal for breakfast.
What do you have? 

Receptionist: Yes, sir. We serve French toast, 
omelet, pancakes with honey, and garden treat scrambled eggs. You can cho
ose from coffee, tea, or fruit juice. 

Jun: What is garden treat scramble eggs exactly? 

Receptionist: It’s scrambled eggs with green onions
 and lettuce. 

Jun: Ok, I’ll have that one with pineapple juice please. 

Receptionist: Ok sir. Breakfast will be served after 10 minutes.

 Here’s your breakfast and your newspaper. 

Jun: Thank you so much. 

Man: Anything else, Sir?  

Jun: That would be all, thank you. 

Man: Welcome Sir. Enjoy your meal.

Jun: Ohm. Excuse me. Before you go, could you recom
mend a nice place to go for a short stroll?
 I’m just new here so 
I don’t have any idea where to go. 

Man: If you’re planning to buy souvenirs, sir, 
there is a public market near this hotel.
They sell things at a very affordable price.
 You can even haggle down to get the things 
you want at even a cheaper price.

I really intend to buy gifts for my friends.

Man: One more thing. Later this afternoon, there wi
